Here I've performed an exercise that I used in practice the type operator "keyof". And also improve my abilities in using Array.prototype.reduce() for a better understanding of how it works.

The main idea of this exercise is to write a code in Typescript that will group an array of objects by a key. I also wrote something similar in Javascript, but with another logic.
